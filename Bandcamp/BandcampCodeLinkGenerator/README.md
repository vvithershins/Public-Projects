You will need to generate a list of bandcamp track/album codes to use this.

 "Your account comes with 200 codes. If you need more, you can either buy them by clicking the “get more” link, below, or you can earn more by selling (we’ll add 1,000 codes for every $500 USD in sales)."
 To generate codes go to https://bandcamp.com/tools and look for Track/album Codes.

Enter your codes into codes.txt, one on each line. example :<br>
abcd-efgh<br>
1234-5678<br>
ijkl-mnop

You can achieve this by opening the exported codes as a txt file with notepad and copying and pasting them into codes.txt

codes.txt comes with provided example codes to show you how it should look. Delete them before you add your codes or you will generate invalid codes.

Enter your bandname when prompted for it (https://(bandname).bandcamp.com, ) to generate the url for you or simply press enter to proceed with the default bandcamp.com/yum url instead of the custom one for your page.

The program automatically generates a list of links based off of the template, and the band-name and codes you provided, you can then easily copy and paste them.

Make sure to save both main.py and codes.txt and in the same folder/directory.
