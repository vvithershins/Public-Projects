You will need to generate a list of bandcamp track/album codes to use this. You will also need to know the name of your bandcamp page. For example https://bandname.bandcamp.com/

Enter your codes into codes.txt, one on each line. example :
abcd-efgh<br>
1234-5678<br>
ijkl-mnop

codes.txt comes with provided example code to show you how it should look. Delete them before you add your codes or you will generate invalid codes.

You can achieve this by opening the exported codes as a txt file with notepad and copying and pasting them into codes.txt

Enter your band name when prompted for it to generate the url for you.

The program automatically generates a list of links based off of the template, and the band-name and codes you provided, you can then easily copy and paste them.

Make sure to save both main.py and codes.txt in the same folder/directory.
